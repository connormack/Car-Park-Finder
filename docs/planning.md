# Project Proposal

## Business Case

### Problem statement
Team UML aims to develop a way for citizens and visitors to easily find somewhere to park their vehicles quickly and efficiently. The Car Park Locator application is the realization of this goal, it is a simple way for its users to find the closest car park to them or a desired location.
The targetted user for this application is any motorist looking for a car park to park their car in Bristol. Motorist refers to any person or group of people, driving a car.

### Business benefits
The Car Park locator application is for anyone who wants to find a car park at a specific location in Bristol. This could be anyone either inside or outside of Bristol, who needed the information now or in the future. Beneficial information that will be included in the application will be car park type, area of its location and the number of spaces. 


### Options Considered
Other possible options include using google map's search for _'car parks near me'_ or asking an individual to point you to the nearest car park. Google maps display a lot of information besides car parks which may be irrelevant to the user. This creates clutter and confusion and may mislead the user. When we ask an individual, there is no guarentee that the person knows the nearest car park. Even if the person knows the location, the directions can not be relayed as clearly and precisely as by information in the database.

### Expected Risks
The app points the user to the nearest car park. However, the app can not check or verify the number of parking spots available at a particular time. Therefore, there is a chance that the car park directed by the app may not have any parking spots left. In that case, the user may have to wait for a spot and lose valuable time. 

## Project Scope
* This project will consist of creating an application that asks the user to input the desired car park area within Bristol and returns the car parks within that area in a table. It will also be able to display a map containing all the car parks. Moreover, the user can choose to view either only the free car parks or the paid ones.
* The project will use Car Park database from Open Data Bristol in order to acess the information required to enable the app to perform it's task. Examples include all the information about numerous car parks in Bristol and the map to represent it. The use of the database in the project is approved by the government with government license V 3.0. [(The license)](http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/version/3/)
* HTML and JavaScript will be used to create the application, which will be suitable for any browser in windows and mac (for example, chrome).
* During the project, the collaborators will use GitHub to store and have common acess to the directory files of the program.
* After the release of the application, if a bug is found either by the collaborators or by the users, the collaborators, after recieving the information about this bug, will locate the error in their program directory and will fix the bug.
* The application will only provide the information of the car parks within Bristol. This is done in order to keep up with the very specific aim of the program **(to help users find suitable car parks within Bristol)**
