# Car Park Finder

The aim of this project is to develop an application that can be used by a motorist (person or a group of people driving a car) to find a suitable car park to park their cars in Bristol. It uses Public [Car parks data](https://opendata.bristol.gov.uk/explore/dataset/car-parks/information/) 
from [Open Data Bristol](https://opendata.bristol.gov.uk).

The function of the application can be divided into three use-cases. A developer within the team is responsible for each use-case. The use-case along with the name of their developer are listed below:-
1) UC1: To allow the user to choose an area of Bristol in a dropdown menu and display all car parks in that area. Alternatively, display all car parks in Bristol. (Developer: Dikshyanta Uprety)
2) UC2: To allow the user to view all car parks in Bristol in a map.  (Developer: Connor Mackintosh)
3) UC3: To allow the user to view the car parks by their type, free or paid.  (Developer: Jeno Labodi)
